# Real-Time Facial Emotion Recognition with Visual Filters and Gamification Using CNN and Flask

This project showcases a real-time Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) system built using a CNN model, Flask backend, and OpenCV video processing pipeline. It features dynamic visual filters, real-time emotion analytics, and an interactive gamification engine that challenges users to match specific emotions within a 30-second window.

> **Note:** Due to GitHub file-size limitations, the dataset, virtual environment (`emotion_env`), and model file (`emotion_cnn_model.h5`) are not uploaded.
